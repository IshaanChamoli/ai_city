# Coding Assignment: Real-Time Chat System with AI Participants

**Duration:** 2 hours

**AI Tools:** Encouraged and recommended

**Language/Stack:** Your choice

---

## Objective

Build a real-time chat system that supports both human users and AI bot participants. This assignment evaluates your ability to:
- Design and implement real-time communication systems
- Integrate AI capabilities into applications
- Make pragmatic architectural decisions under time constraints
- Write clean, maintainable code with AI assistance

---

## Core Requirements

### 1. Real-Time Messaging
- Support one-on-one conversations between users or (between a user and a bot)
- Support group channels where multiple users and bots can participate
- Messages should appear in real-time (no manual refresh required)

### 2. AI Bot Integration in a channel
- Implement at least one AI bot that can join channels
- The bot should have a specific behavior/personality (examples: weather bot, joke bot, math helper, etc.)
- Bot should intelligently respond only to relevant messages (stay silent otherwise)

### 3. Data Persistence
- Chat history must survive server restarts
- Users should see message history when joining a channel or conversation

### 4. Client Interface
- Build a minimalistic client to demonstrate the functionality
- Can be web-based, CLI, or any interface

## Bonus Feature (Optional)

If you have time left, Implement one these:

- **Scalability design**: Architecture that could handle millions of users
- **Typing indicators**: Show when someone is typing
- **File sharing**: Support sending images or files
- **Observability**: Logging, metrics, or monitoring setup

---

## Technical Guidelines

- **Working code**: Prioritize a functional demo
- **AI tool usage**: Use coding agents/tools like Gemini, Claude Code, Cursor, etc. to maximize productivity. If you use an API and costs you, we will cover it.

After the test, send a zip of:
- your codebase
- full thread of your coding agent
- screenshots of demo

**Good luck! We're excited to see what you build!**
